```{r}
library("recommenderlab")
```

# Data import

```{r}
data_package <- data(package = "recommenderlab")
data_package$results[,"Item"]
```

```{r}
data("MovieLense")
class(MovieLense)
```

Note the data is in the realRatingMatrix class, which is optimized for sparse matrices. 

```{r}
methods(class = class(MovieLense))
```

See it as a regular matrix. 
**This is essentially the matrix form we have for our project**
```{r}
MovieLense.matrix <- as(MovieLense, "matrix")
head(MovieLense.matrix)[,1:5]
```




# Computing the Similarity Matrix

```{r}
similarity_users <- similarity(MovieLense[1:4], method = "cosine", which = "users")
```
